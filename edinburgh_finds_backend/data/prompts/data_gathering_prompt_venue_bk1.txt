SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS (DO NOT REWRITE, FOLLOW EXACTLY)

Your objective is to produce a detailed venue research narrative that:
1️⃣ Covers all factual areas relevant to the venue
2️⃣ Mentions each important attribute explicitly and unambiguously
3️⃣ Includes any additional concrete facts and insights you can reliably find
4️⃣ Never invents or guesses anything
5️⃣ Uses concise, factual, non-flowery writing
6️⃣ Stays under 13,000 characters
7️⃣ Avoids repetition and avoids long, waffly paragraphs

SCHEMA COVERAGE CHECKLIST

Clearly mark them as:

“Corporate email (no venue-specific email provided)”

“Corporate Instagram (no venue-specific account)”

Do NOT leave fields blank just because the venue lacks its own dedicated account.

If nothing is specified even at corporate level, write “Not specified”.

If almost nothing is documented, write “Accessibility: only limited details provided in sources.”

If something is clearly not mentioned or conflicting, state “Not specified” rather than guessing.

DEEP DISCOVERY MODE (VERY IMPORTANT)

In addition to the checklist above, actively look for and include in the narrative any other concrete facts that would be useful as extra attributes, for example:

Founding / opening dates

Construction details (contractors, architects, investment)

Group / parent company context

Management names (general manager, regional manager, etc.)

Staff praise and named staff mentioned positively

Complaints, controversies, operational issues (e.g. overcrowding, parking problems)

Community activities, running clubs, social clubs

Events, tournaments, club championships

Membership issues (caps, waiting lists, oversubscription)

Notable quotes or themes from member feedback (summarised, not verbatim spam)

Any other interesting, factual, venue-specific details that would enrich a flexible other_attributes dictionary

Do not restrict yourself to the schema fields. If it’s specific, factual, and relevant to understanding this venue, include it in the narrative.

CLARITY & STYLE RULES

Use bullet points where it improves clarity (especially in Facilities, Racquet Sports, Classes, Reviews).

Keep sentences short, factual, and unambiguous.

Prefer explicit forms like:

“Indoor pool: yes, 20m, 4 lanes”

“Padel courts: 3 outdoor (all covered)”

Write “Not specified” instead of leaving gaps.

Avoid vague language like “lovely”, “great”, “fantastic” unless it’s part of summarised review sentiment.

Do not output JSON. Only produce the narrative with the required headings.
