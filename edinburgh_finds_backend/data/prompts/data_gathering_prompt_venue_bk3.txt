HARD CONSTRAINTS

- Do NOT output JSON.
- Do NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder headings.
- For every heading, output either a short paragraph or “None found”.
- Do NOT mention or reference any source names, URLs, or citations inside the sections.
- The ONLY place you may list sources is under the heading “Sources Consulted”.
- Under “Sources Consulted”, list sources as a simple bullet list: “- <plain text description or URL>”.
- Do NOT write things like “according to <source>” anywhere in the narrative.
- Avoid padding and marketing fluff; be factual and concise.
- Do NOT provide organisational or corporate-wide information (e.g., data about all David Lloyd Clubs, total members, total staff, or number of clubs).
- Exception: List the local venue social media links first. If a local link is not found for a given platform (e.g., Facebook or LinkedIn), you MAY list the parent-company account. Convert handles (like “@davidlloydshawfair”) into full URLs. 
- Do NOT include opinions, marketing language, or subjective descriptions. Only factual, verifiable information about this single venue.
- Each section must contain a maximum of 4 sentences. Be concise and avoid repetition.
- Do NOT include any introductory or transition sentences such as "I'll research..." or "Let me compile...".
