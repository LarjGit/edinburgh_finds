HARD CONSTRAINTS

– Do NOT output JSON.
– Do NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder section headings.
– For every section, output either a short paragraph or “None found”.
– Do NOT reference, quote, or mention any source names, URLs, or citations inside sections.
– The ONLY place you may list sources is under “Sources Consulted”.
– Under “Sources Consulted”, list each source as a simple bullet point: “- <plain text description or URL>”.
– Do NOT use phrases like “according to”, “based on”, or “source says” anywhere outside the final section.
– Avoid marketing language, opinions, or subjective descriptions; provide factual, verifiable information only.
– Do NOT include corporate-level data (e.g., total clubs, total members, global staffing numbers).
– Exception for social media: If venue-specific social media accounts cannot be found, you MAY use parent-company accounts in the “Social Media Information” section ONLY.
– Each section must contain a maximum of 4 sentences; be concise and avoid repetition.
– Do NOT include introductory or transitional phrases (e.g., “I researched…”, “Here is…”).

SOCIAL MEDIA REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)

In “Social Media Information”, follow this strict priority order for each platform:

1. Use the venue-specific account if it exists.
2. If no venue account exists, use the parent-company account.

Check the following platforms in this exact order:
• Instagram
• Facebook
• LinkedIn
• Twitter/X
• TikTok
• YouTube

Rules for formatting social media:
– Provide **full URLs**, not handles.
– Include as many platforms as can be confidently identified.
– If no account exists for a platform at either level, omit that platform.

GENERAL CONTENT RULES

– Use factual statements only; avoid interpretation or speculation.
– Include all relevant details about the venue’s facilities, amenities, services, staff, accessibility, and offerings.
– Do NOT include organisational history, global company details, or content not specifically about this venue.
– If conflicting information appears online, choose the most authoritative and widely corroborated value.
– If a detail is unclear or cannot be verified, omit it rather than guessing.
