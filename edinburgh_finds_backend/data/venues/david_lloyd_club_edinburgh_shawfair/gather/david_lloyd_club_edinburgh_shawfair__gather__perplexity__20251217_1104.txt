  - Latitude: 55.91050  
  - Longitude: -3.07510  
  These coordinate values align with the Shawfair Park cluster at Old Dalkeith Road, EH22 1FD where the club and its car park are located, but exact official coordinates to 5 decimal places are not explicitly published by the club.[2][5][3]

### Extended facilities and activities

- Padel courts: External racquet directories list David Lloyd Edinburgh Shawfair in padel‑related venue listings, implying presence of padel tennis courts at the club.[11][12][13]
- Indoor and outdoor play: External venue directories describe “indoor play” and “outdoor play” amenities at David Lloyd Edinburgh Shawfair, which is consistent with the indoor playframe and outdoor playground described by the operator.[13][1]
- Social events: Membership‑oriented content references regular social events and community‑building activities at David Lloyd Edinburgh Shawfair, consistent with the wider David Lloyd Clubs model of social events and club life.[14][15][1]

GRADE C — Low Confidence (Weakly Supported)
-------------------------------------------

### Additional activities and amenities (unconfirmed detail level)

- Specific class menu: While Blaze, Cyclone and SPIRIT are explicitly named, it is highly likely but not directly verified in official Shawfair‑specific copy that the club also offers:
  - General strength, conditioning and cardio classes  
  - Pilates, yoga and other mind‑body formats  
  - Aqua classes in the pool  
  These are standard across David Lloyd clubs but not individually enumerated for Shawfair in primary sources.[15][14][1]
- Restaurant/cafe details: Third‑party and membership‑focused articles describe a broad clubroom menu with options for all ages and family‑friendly dishes; however, exact menu items, brands (e.g. Starbucks or equivalent), and dietary provision specifics are not clearly detailed in primary sources.[15][1]
- Workspace amenities: It is typical, but not explicitly enumerated, that the business area offers Wi‑Fi, power outlets and mixed seating (tables, soft seating), in line with other David Lloyd Clubrooms.[14][1]

### Membership and pricing

- Membership categories: External pricing guides describe multiple membership types at David Lloyd Edinburgh Shawfair, including categories such as individual, joint, family and off‑peak; exact names, benefits and current prices can vary and should be confirmed directly with the club.[15]
- Trial offers: Third‑party pages sometimes reference introductory or promotional offers (e.g. joining offers around launch), but details change over time and are not fully verifiable as current.[15][1]

### Specific transport routes and times

- Individual bus route numbers and frequencies: Transport aggregators can provide route numbers that stop near Shawfair Park and Old Dalkeith Road, but these change periodically and are not fixed in authoritative static text; exact current services require live journey planning.[3][9]

### Detailed review metrics

- Average star rating: Some directories show star ratings for David Lloyd Edinburgh Shawfair, but sample sizes are small or not timestamped; therefore, any numeric average rating is tentative and may not reflect the current consensus.[5][2][10]
- Thematic sentiment (e.g. “best for families”, “best for spa”): Travel and gym blogs may make qualitative claims about the club’s strengths, but these are subjective and not formally validated.[5][14][15]
