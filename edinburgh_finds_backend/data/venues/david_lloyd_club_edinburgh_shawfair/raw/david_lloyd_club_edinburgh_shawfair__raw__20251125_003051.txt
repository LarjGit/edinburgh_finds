Source-specific information (from pre-opening press releases):

Conflict note: The David Lloyd website states "twelve indoor and seven outdoor tennis courts" but architectural sources and pre-opening press releases state "4 tennis courts inside an aerodome" and "3 outdoor tennis courts." The "12 indoor, 7 outdoor" appears to be template language used across multiple David Lloyd clubs.
