GRADE C — Low Confidence (Weakly Supported)
Social media profiles
Instagram: The official website repeatedly references “Instagram” in its footer, implying an active Instagram account, but the exact handle is not fully visible in the brief snippets; likely structured as an official club account.​

Facebook: Similarly, there is a “Facebook” link in the site footer pointing to an official Facebook page; the exact URL and page name need direct verification.​

Twitter (now X): The footer also lists “Twitter”, implying an account under the club’s name, but the precise handle cannot be confidently extracted from current snippets.​

Detailed parking information
Free parking: An event listing for an external organisation hosting at Edinburgh Sports Club notes that parking at the venue is free for attendees.​

Capacity and layout: No authoritative, recent data specifies the number of spaces, EV charging availability, or layout, so assumptions about size or configuration remain unverified.

Fine-grained opening hours (sub-facilities)
Bar/restaurant hours: It is plausible that food service and bar opening hours differ from the general club opening hours, but explicit times are not clearly documented in the available sources.​

Holiday hours: Any Christmas/New Year or bank-holiday variations are not published clearly in the sources accessed and would need direct confirmation.

Review specifics
Individual review comments: Some reviews on travel or local directory sites reference staff helpfulness and facility quality, but these are user-generated and may not represent current conditions or policies.​

GRADE X — Not Found / Too Uncertain
These attributes could not be reliably established from the consulted sources and should be treated as unknown without direct confirmation from the club.

Precise, confirmed URLs and handles for Instagram, Facebook and Twitter/X (links exist but target details are not clearly exposed).
