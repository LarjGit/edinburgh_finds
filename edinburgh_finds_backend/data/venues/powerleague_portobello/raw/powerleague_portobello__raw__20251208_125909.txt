DATA EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY NOTES
This comprehensive dataset was compiled using a confidence-grading system to ensure data accuracy and traceability:

Grade A data comes directly from official Powerleague sources (website, social media)
Grade B data appears on at least one authoritative source with strong corroboration
Grade C data is from secondary sources or requires human verification
Grade X data represents attributes where reliable information could not be located

All contact information, addresses, and primary business details are verified against multiple authoritative sources. GPS coordinates are geocoded to 5 decimal places (≈1.1m precision) from the official postcode.
The venue is part of the wider Powerleague network but maintains distinct local character with its Club Manager Nicola Brant overseeing operations. The facility has evolved to become a multi-sport destination, particularly notable for its recent addition of covered padel courts alongside its established football offerings.
